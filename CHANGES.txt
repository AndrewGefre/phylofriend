- YFull input refined and tested.
- Fixed YstrMarkerTable and added new markers.

2016-02-20
- Command line parameter personsin now excepts a directory
  containing files in YFull format.
  This code is untested.

- genetic.Distance: Removed special handling for DYS389i.
- Code clean up for genetic.Distance.
  The genetic distance calculation is still only valid for
  up to 111 markers, although the program uses 500 markers
  for comparison.
- Files containing mutation rates: Zero values were deleted
  for better clarity.

- Bug fix: genetic.Distance

- genetic: All calculations on Y-STR markers are now
  done using arrays instead of structures. This is much
  more suited for large numbers of markers than the
  previous approach.
- genfiles: JSON input/output functions were rewritten
  due to the use of arrays in the genetic package.

2016-02-14
- genetic: Added translation table for 500 markers.
  Currently this has no effect on the running program.
  In the future the calculation of genetic distances
  will be performed using arrays instead of structures.
  This will simplify the calculations but require
  additional programming for input output operations
  and debugging.

Changes in program behaviour to improve usability:

- Command line parameter "nvalues" changed to "nmarkers".
  I believe this is easier to understand and to remember.

- Default value for generation time is now 1 instead of 25.
  This means that the genetic distance is computed in
  generations instead of years as default.
  A generation time of 25 years has shown to be a bad
  choice. 32 years is more appropriate.

- genetic.MutationRates had been replaced by 
  genetic.DefaultMutationRates(), a function that returns
  a set of markers where all values are set to 1. This
  makes mutation counting the default behaviour.
  The previously used 37 marker mutation rates have not
  proven to be of great value in practice.

- In the directory "mutationrates" all files containing
  marker sets of only Ones where deleted. They are now
  obsolete.

Readability improvements:

- Nmarkers has been changed to MaxMarkers.

- nValues has been changed to nMarkers in function
  definitions.
