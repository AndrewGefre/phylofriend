\section{Installation}

This guide is mainly targeted towards persons who use Linux Mint
or other Linux versions of the Debian family. Some familiarity
with the use of Linux commands is assumed.

Currently there are no binary distributions available for
Windows or the Mac. Users of these operating systems can
use Phylofriend as well, but they will experience some
laborious installation work. The best way is to follow the
instructions provided on the
\href{http://golang.org/}{Go} home page and the
\href{http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html}{PHYLIP}
home page.

The following list applies to Linux users only:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure that the Go programming language is installed.
	If not it can be installed by typing\\
	\texttt{sudo apt-get install golang}
\item Read the Go
	\href{http://golang.org/doc/install}{Getting Started}
	guide. Make sure to set your \emph{GOPATH} variable and
	include it in your \emph{PATH} so that Go programs can be
	found.
\item For the creation of phylogenetic trees install the
	PHYLIP program package by typing\\
	\texttt{sudo apt-get install phylip}
\item Fetch the Phylofriend program with\\
	\texttt{go get github.com/yogischogi/phylofriend}
\item Install the program with\\
	 \texttt{go install github.com/yogischogi/phylofriend}
\end{enumerate}
